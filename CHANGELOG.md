</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.9</summary>
Buffed the handlamp, buffed the walking cane slightly, and the walking cane now properly spawns on titan, dine, and rend. The 4.0.0 update may take a bit longer as I have quite a few items I'm creating that will require more attention and testing to work properly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.0</summary>
Cleaned up a ton of beginner code, first try syncing the explosive tank's explosion (If you're reading this please report issues on github, multiplayer issues are difficult to test solo), fixed the models and cleaned up their textures, fixed some of the items floating when spawning the first time, more stuff probably. The items I planned to add are on hold to see if this implementation of the explosive tank works, If everything seems to be working I will add them next update.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.1</summary>
New batch of items including: the toolbox, radioactive mineral cell, and gift wrap all with a new unique use or effect, new icons again. As always, this was tested in singleplayer and while I did account for multiplayer if any inconsistencies or bugs occur let me know on my github.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.2</summary>

- Shrunk the handlamp so it doesn't cover as much screen space when held.
- Fixed random inconsistencies.
- Hopefully fixed the toolbox's syncing (forgot one word!).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.3</summary>

### It's been a while since I started this update so I'll just note all the changes I can recall.

- The Toolbox is now button presses instead of holding to use.
- The Medkit is now hold to heal instead of toggle.
- Replaced the Gift wrap with the Wish list.
- "radioactive mineral cell" is now named "radioactive cell" because name too long.
- Added the sizable scissors scrap item.
- Various model tweaks or redoes.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs I found that weren't too serious so I'm assuming nobody experienced them enough to report them.
- A ton of code changes and improvements probably.
- Replenished motivation.

#### And now for balance tweaks that I remember changing.

- The Medkit costs less and heals slightly faster.
- Bandages heal more with less charges (20 x 3) and now have a .5 second cooldown between uses.
- When dismantling turrets with the toolbox it has a chance of dropping a high value laser pointer.
- Explosive tank timer can be any time between 2-4 minutes.
- Walking cane nerfed again because I felt literally untouchable running from monsters with it in hand so now it's speed boost is 2x.

#### The next update shouldn't take as long, and as always, please report any issues on the GitHub page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.4</summary>

### The First in a line of refinement updates.

- The Handlamp now uses it's own script so it shouldn't be affected by mods that change the flashlight but will still be affected by mods that change world lighting.
- The Handlamp no longer shows the flashlight's headlight when pocketed.
- The Handlamp is the first and only item to receive sounds. More items will have sounds added gradually.
- Fixed the radioactive cells model clipping from some angles and changed it's holding position.
- Fix for the harmless toolbox use error.
- Fix for the radioactive cell keeping it's previous name when scanned.
- Lowered the amount of clicks for the toolbox slightly and removed the click cooldown so clicking too quickly won't only count some clicks.
- Drastically improved the icons for everything.
- Candy jar disabled for now while I decide what to do with it.

#### That's all for now. If any issues arise from the Handlamp's new script (as I only tested it in singleplayer) report the issue and I'll fix it asap.

##### Also, I'm looking to change the name of the mod without having to post this as a new mod so if anyone knows how, I could really use the advice. I was considering just changing the name in the files but I don't want to break user's games by accident.

### The ..stable? update.

- Completely rewrote how the handlamp code functions.

- Messed with the medical kit, hopefully it works correctly now. probably not.

### An update of all time.

- Crowbar takes two-three hits to unlock a locked door instead of 1 and will knock it open.
- Crowbar can knock open unlocked closed doors by hitting them once.
- Reduced time to heal with the medical kit.
- The medical kit now replenishes its healthpool overtime instead of being restocked at the ship, it'll take a bit to get it balanced right but it's a start.
- Possibly fixed spawning issues with all items including the tickets, dispenser, and toolbox. Or made it worse, we shall see.
- Tweaked spawn rates a bit.
- Model tweaks.

Planned Additions/Changes - defib For real this time.

I've been working on a few more interesting items but with my new job and needing to learn new code stuff for them it's taking a bit longer, and I just wanted to get this update out. If there are ANY issues, the link to my github is at the top of the page!

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.0</summary>

### The laying foundations update 1/2

- Tried to sync the padlock's door locking mechanic between players so you can lock your friends in rooms. You asked for it.
- Added the Defibrillator (disabled by default for testing. If you'd like to try it, enable it in the configs, but expect bugs).
- Added the Lifeline (disabled by default for testing. If you'd like to try it, enable it in the configs, but expect bugs).
- Added the Pocket Watch (Was supposed to have a function but I gave it's function to the Lifeline Device after I had already made its model. If you have any ideas what it should do I'd love to hear them).
- Added the adrenaline shot
- Removed candies.
- Restored some textures that mysteriously disappeared.
- Reduced the handlamp's battery capacity slightly so I could boost it's light reach slightly
- Made dropping the explosive tank deduct less time so new users have more time to think about picking it back up and so dropping it the first couple times isn't as punishing.
- The explosive tank's dropping mechanics are now completely disabled when dropped within the ship. Hitting it still blows it up.
- Messed with the spawn values again, one day maybe they'll feel correct.
- Worked on the spawn method for everything again.
- Increased the chance to spawn candy with the candy dispenser slightly.
- Tweaked the toolbox's trap detection to be more stable and accurate because it turns out landmines just have a weird collider or something. It also works more consistently while crounching now.
- Increased the value of scrap produced by the toolbox and slightly reduced it's cost because everytime I buy a toolbox it feels like traps mysteriously cease to exist.
- Changed some item's weights.
- Stuff I forgot about.


Planned Additions/Changes - Use medkit on teamates to heal them functionality, I actually hate doing ui but the toolbox will get ui someday, ...

The next update will have bug fixes for issues I recieve, some configs (I hate coding configs), effects/animations/sounds I didn't do due to lack of time, and probably balancing changes after I playtest the additions. I'm going to bed...
Report ANY and ALL issues if possible, the link to my github is at the top of the page!

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.1</summary>

### Small follow-up update

- Undid some changes I made that just broke more stuff.
- Various fixes
- Fixed defib and lifeline not having battery initially.
- Made defib and lifeline disabled by default like I intended.
- Increased the toolbox price.
- Fixed plenty of incorrect code.
- I'm redoing most icons so those will be coming soon but I've added temporary icons to the new items.
- Tweaked some of the models.

Planned Additions/Changes - I'm messing with the defib model and will add It's icon when I finish it (the white square on the hotbar is a missing item texture not a bug), some sounds are still missing, some effects are still missing, rename lifeline, more bugs.

Pretty tired so the next update will take a few days unless a bug is critical, see y'all then. If there are ANY issues, the link to my github is at the top of the page!

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.2 & 1.6.3</summary>

### Coat of paint update 2/2  (THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK SAVES WITH PREVIOUS MOD VERSIONS, THERE ARE LOTS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CHANGES)

- Fixed an OLD major bug that caused the medical kit and bandages to stop working after a day or reset.
- Fixed ticket uses not registering.
- Gave candy dispenser it's damage back, that change wasn't intentional.
- When items are destroyed (Tank exploding, Ticket used, etc.) their radar icons are now destroyed with them.
- Many new/redone item icons.
- Added configs for spawn rate and store cost. I will not be adding anymore configs anytime soon, this was tedious.
- Renamed some items. Lifeline -> Displacement Controller, Adrenaline Injector -> Emergency Injector, Broken Pocket Watch -> Pocket Watch.
- Displacement Controller heavily polished code wise and balanced so for now I will enable it by default.
- Added missing sounds.
- Tweaked models some more.
- Fixed pocket watch scan node not being where it's supposed to be.

- 1.6.3 -> Forgot to update the README with updated information :)

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.4</summary>

### Bugfixes, consolidation.

- Fixed Handlamp staying on when running out of battery.
- Reduced light intensity of the controller's screen so it might not be so bright on modded moons.
- Removed unused assets and references.
- Reduced the glitch time of the controller a bit, extended the first connectivity stage range a bit.
- Changed the teleport method of the controller so it hopefully works for clients now.

Planned Additions/Changes - I'm messing with the defib model and will add It's icon when I finish it (the white square on the hotbar is a missing item texture not a bug), some sounds are still missing, some effects are still missing, rename lifeline, more bugs.

This'll be all for this weekend! See y'all next weekend! If there are ANY issues, the link to my github is at the top of the page!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.5</summary>

### Small Update.

- Shrunk the handlamp model by around 1/3.
- Tried to make the candy spawned by the dispenser update the prices on the clients so everyone can see the price. If it works I will do this to all the other items that spawn other items.
- Smoothed out displacement controller code and added more checks. It should be close if not complete code wise unless some random bugs crop up.
- Medical kit and bandages now update the hurt overlay and ui as you are healed. You also won't be stuck limping when healing over 20 with either of them as that is also updated.
- Tried to make defib work v2.

Planned Additions/Changes - Defib is still being messed with, more bugs, already brainstorming/creating some new dangerous scrap items.

If there are ANY issues, the link to my github is at the top of the page! I am also on the modding discord.

### The mass fix update 1/2

# 99% SURE THIS WILL BREAK WITH PREVIOUS SAVES.

It's been a little bit but I've not stopped working on the mod in my free time. This is the first of two updates that contains all of the fixes that have been reported or have been found by me playtesting the mod. Because of the shear amount of playtesting and bug fixing I had to do, I decided to postpone the new items until the next update and most of the extra visual effects and sounds will also be added then.

- Medical kit replenish rate slowed so that 2 or 3 of them will increase the amount of available health more drastically instead of one giving basically infinite health to the entire crew.
- Medical kit Healthpool is now set to max at the start of each planet.
- Fixed a couple instances where the handlamp would use battery when it shouldn't.
- Defibrillator now has sounds and works correctly.
- Tickets now work as intended.
- The rose will now apply a small slowness debuff each time it damages you.
- Brought back a few of my candies as special drops from the candy dispenser. The rest were lost to the void. The candies all do the same thing, they restore 10 health and give a very minor speed boost.
- Padlocks locking doors is now synced between players.
- Candy dispenser no longer spawns candy if the ship is in space, is currently in motion, or the current moon doesn't have a time cycle.
- The injector no longer heals, increases your sprint meter capacity, gives more speed, gives a jump buff, and changes your sprint meter color while active.
- The injector also drains your sprint meter and gives you a short slow debuff when the speed expires. Your sprint meter will also change to a seperate color while the slow is active.
- When used by clients the crowbar will now properly open the doors when unlocking locked doors.
- Model changes, new color variations for some objects, and improved effects for some objects.
- Fixed scissors not correctly being registered as a scrap item.
- Renamed displacement controller to shift controller to avoid terminal issues.
- Halved the glitch chance of the shift controller in the average connection range.
- Added a cushion to when the glitchs start randomly rolling in the average connection range so it can't roll to glitch as soon as you leave the great connection range.
- Spent like 5 hours trying to make a simple screen effect and have nothing to show for it. Maybe another time.
- Switched out most of the objects networking to my own networking and tested it so I ended up redoing most of them several times to get them working correctly and synced. This is what delayed this update so long.
- The most noticable fixes are above but I fixed an insane amount of bugs that I did not bother recording here.

Planned Additions/Changes - Finish new items, rework the toolbox's function, looking at making a monster at some point but no promises.

May be a couple fix updates after if needed but otherwise I'll be taking a short break. If there are ANY issues, the link to my github is at the top of the page! The mod is also on the modding discord under the name "Usual Scrap" with a space.

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.7</summary>

### Quick follow up fixes

- Fixed defibrillator working without being fully charged.
- Possibly fixed duplicate dead bodies when using the defibrillator.
- In addition to being cut in half any death that removes your head is also impossible to revive.
- Ticket use on corpses is now disabled.
- Fixed some typos.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.8</summary>

### Quick follow up fixes #2

- Fixed crowbar doing it's functions multiple times when used in multiplayer resulting in it one-shotting stuff sometimes and open/closing doors rapidly.
- Updated content image.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.6.9</summary>

### Update

I don't like going weeks without updating if I can help it so if an item taking long to make (frigid capsule in this case) i'm just going to update with what I have and the item will sit until it's done.

- Removed leftover logging.
- Fixed injector draining stamina instead of restoring stamina initially.
- removed injector changing ui colors because of problems, will figure something else out.
- Shift controller no longer glitches from just being dropped inside the ship.
- Fixed harmless ticket error.
- Increased the great connection range of the shift controller by around 30%.
- Pocketwatch disabled.
- Hopefully fixed defibrillator bodies being duplicated or remaining upon revival for good.
- Made some light attempts at fixing a inconsistent invisible model issue upon revival (I tried some light fixes because I don't want to break other stuff doing random changes).
- Added check so slowing effects won't go negative and reverse your controls.
- Added Gloomy Capsule.
- Added Frigid Capsule (Still a bit unstable).
- Items that spawned on hard moons only now also spawn on any modded moons. Looking into spawning items based on the interior instead of the moon if possible.

Upcoming - Toolbox rebuild,golden ticket changes, some new configs, a few more items eventually.
