Figured out how this website works and made some name changes to avoid conflicts with other mods.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.6</summary>
Added a github? New textures, fixes, nothing major.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.7</summary>
Fixed for v50
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.8</summary>
Fixed the scrap values not being the correct value in-game, nerfed the walking cane speed, added effects to using the medkit and bandages, fixed bandages not giving enough uses, fixed medkit logic, probably fixed some other stuff.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.9</summary>
Buffed the handlamp, buffed the walking cane slightly, and the walking cane now properly spawns on titan, dine, and rend. The 4.0.0 update may take a bit longer as I have quite a few items I'm creating that will require more attention and testing to work properly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.0</summary>
Cleaned up a ton of beginner code, first try syncing the explosive tank's explosion (If you're reading this please report issues on github, multiplayer issues are difficult to test solo), fixed the models and cleaned up their textures, fixed some of the items floating when spawning the first time, more stuff probably. The items I planned to add are on hold to see if this implementation of the explosive tank works, If everything seems to be working I will add them next update.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.1</summary>
New batch of items including: the toolbox, radioactive mineral cell, and gift wrap all with a new unique use or effect, new icons again. As always, this was tested in singleplayer and while I did account for multiplayer if any inconsistencies or bugs occur let me know on my github.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.2</summary>

- Shrunk the handlamp so it doesn't cover as much screen space when held.
- Fixed random inconsistencies.
- Hopefully fixed the toolbox's syncing (forgot one word!).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.3</summary>

#### It's been a while since I started this update so I'll just note all the changes I remember.

- The Toolbox is now button presses instead of holding to use.
- The Medkit is now hold to heal instead of toggle.
- Replaced the Gift wrap with the Wish list.
- "radioactive mineral cell" is now named "radioactive cell" because name too long.
- Added the sizable scissors scrap item.
- Various model tweaks or redoes.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs I found that weren't too serious so I'm assuming nobody experienced them enough to report them.
- A ton of code changes and improvements probably.
- Replenished motivation.

#### And now for balance tweaks that I remember changing.

- The Medkit costs less and heals slightly faster.
- Bandages heal more with less charges (20 x 3) and now have a .5 second cooldown between uses.
- When dismantling turrets with the toolbox it has a chance of dropping a high value laser pointer.
- Explosive tank timer can be any time between 2-4 minutes.
- Walking cane nerfed again because I felt literally untouchable running from monsters with it in hand so now it's speed boost is 2x.

#### The next update shouldn't take as long, and as always, please report any issues on the GitHub page.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.4</summary>

#### The First in a line of refinement updates. New items added after this will try to stay equal or above the quality of the current items meaning it may take slightly longer before I post a new item.

- The Handlamp now uses it's own script so it shouldn't be affected by mods that change the flashlight but will still be affected by mods that change world lighting.
- The Handlamp no longer shows the flashlight's headlight when pocketed.
- The Handlamp is the first and only item to receive sounds. More items will have sounds added gradually.
- Fixed the radioactive cells model clipping from some angles and changed it's holding position.
- Fix for the harmless toolbox use error.
- Fix for the radioactive cell keeping it's previous name when scanned.
- Lowered the amount of clicks for the toolbox slightly and removed the click cooldown so clicking too quickly won't only count some clicks.
- Drastically improved the icons for everything.
- Candy jar disabled for now while I decide what to do with it.

#### That's all for now. If any issues arise from the Handlamp's new script (as I only tested it in singleplayer) report the issue and I'll fix it asap.

##### Also, I'm looking to change the name of the mod without having to post this as a new mod so if anyone knows how, I could really use the advice. I was considering just changing the name in the files but I don't want to break user's games by accident.
