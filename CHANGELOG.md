<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.5</summary>

- Changed how the explosive tank works and changed the testing spawn rate I had forgot to change (my bad)
- Disabled the crowbar and nail because I'm not happy with them
- Worked on the defibrillator some more
- Added the walking cane
- A whole bunch of random fixes
</details>

<summary>Version 1.3.6</summary>
Added a github? New textures, fixes, nothing major.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.7</summary>
Fixed for v50
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.8</summary>
Fixed the scrap values not being the correct value in-game, nerfed the walking cane speed, added effects to using the medkit and bandages, fixed bandages not giving enough uses, fixed medkit logic, probably fixed some other stuff.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.3.9</summary>
Buffed the handlamp, buffed the walking cane slightly, and the walking cane now properly spawns on titan, dine, and rend. The 4.0.0 update may take a bit longer as I have quite a few items I'm creating that will require more attention and testing to work properly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.0</summary>
Cleaned up a ton of beginner code, first try syncing the explosive tank's explosion (If you're reading this please report issues on github, multiplayer issues are difficult to test solo), fixed the models and cleaned up their textures, fixed some of the items floating when spawning the first time, more stuff probably. The items I planned to add are on hold to see if this implementation of the explosive tank works, If everything seems to be working I will add them next update.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.1</summary>
New batch of items including: the toolbox, radioactive mineral cell, and gift wrap all with a new unique use or effect, new icons again. As always, this was tested in singleplayer and while I did account for multiplayer if any inconsistencies or bugs occur let me know on my github.</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.2</summary>

- Shrunk the handlamp so it doesn't cover as much screen space when held.
- Fixed random inconsistencies.
- Hopefully fixed the toolbox's syncing (forgot one word!).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Version 1.4.3</summary>

#### It's been a while since I started this update so I'll just note all the changes I remember.

- The Toolbox is now button presses instead of holding to use.
- The Medkit is now hold to heal instead of toggle.
- Replaced the Gift wrap with the Wish list.
- "radioactive mineral cell" is now named "radioactive cell" because name too long.
- Added the sizable scissors scrap item.
- Various model tweaks or redoes.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs I found that weren't too serious so I'm assuming nobody experienced them enough to report them.
- A ton of code changes and improvements probably.
- Replenished motivation.

#### And now for balance tweaks that I remember changing.

- The Medkit costs less and heals slightly faster.
- Bandages heal more with less charges (20 x 3) and now have a .5 second cooldown between uses.
- When dismantling turrets with the toolbox it has a chance of dropping a high value laser pointer.
- Explosive tank timer can be any time between 2-4 minutes.
- Walking cane nerfed again because I felt literally untouchable running from monsters with it in hand so now it's speed boost is 2x.

#### The next update shouldn't take as long, and as always, please report any issues on the GitHub page.
