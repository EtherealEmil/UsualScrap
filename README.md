<summary>Bandages</summary>

Costs 25 credits, Weighs 1

Bandages are a consumable with 5 charges that heal 8 health each.

Unlike the medkit, Bandages heal you instantly and are a cheaper short-term option.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Medkit</summary>

![](SEEME/MedkitPreview.png)
Costs 150 credits, Weighs 5

The medkit gradually heals the holder using a hidden health pool that depletes while healing.

Unlike the bandages, the medkit's base health pool can heal 6 times the health one bandage item can heal if given enough time. Additionally, its health pool can be refilled by bringing it into the ship. In the future, I plan to add a feature that will allow players to use the medkit on their teammates without having to drop it for them.

## Unique Scrap Items

<details>
<summary>Explosive Tank (dangerous scrap item)</summary>

![](SEEME/ExplosiveTankPreview.png)
Once the explosive tank is picked up, an internal timer begins counting down until it reaches 0 and the tank will then explode. The only way to stop the timer is by bringing the tank inside the ship.

- Hitting the tank with a melee weapon will cause it to explode immediately.
- Each time the tank is dropped, its remaining time will be reduced by a set amount. If the tank is dropped three times, it will explode immediately.
- The internal timer can start at any time between 2 and 4 minutes.
- Spawns on any moon rarely.

![](SEEME/WalkingCanePreview.png)
Increases your move speed when held.

- Currently spawns on dine very rarely.

<summary>Mod Interactions</summary>

- Mods that affect flashlights may affect the handlamp.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Mod Compatability Issues</summary>

- "FlashlightExtendedRange" Makes the handlamp insanely bright when it's turned on.

- "Diversity" will make the handlamp brighter, I don't think it's too bad but it isn't the brightness I intended.
