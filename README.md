## Purchasable Equipment

<details>
<summary>Handlamp (25C)</summary>

Costs 25 credits, Weighs 5

Compared to vanilla flashlights...

PROS

- The lamp lights produces light in a radius around you making it useful for seeing things all around you and completely lighting up small rooms.

- The lamp has a much larger battery capacity than the pro-flashlight (It's battery can last almost the entire day even when left on constantly!).

CONS 

- The light produced by the lamp isn't as clear at long ranges as the pro-flashlight nor does it reach as far.

- The lamp's light can be very bright if used in fog, gas, smoke, dust storms, etc..

Mod Issue - Mods messing with lighting can drastically affect the Hand Lamp's light. I probably won't find a universal way to fix this issue.

<details>
<summary>Bandages(20C)</summary>

Costs 20 credits, Weighs 1

Costs 120 credits, Weighs 3

The Medical Kit heals the user overtime using it's internal stored health. It's internal health caps out at 100 and will pssively replenish when not in use.

Compared to Bandages, the Medical Kit can heal more health (100) than Bandages can heal (60) and can heal infinitely if given time to replenish. 

For Update 1.7.3 users and above - The medkit can now be used to directly heal other employees and heals them faster than normal (2x faster). This can be done by looking at your fellow employee and using the medkit just like you're healing yourself with it, same healthpool and all.</details>

<details>
<summary>Productivity Auto-Injector(90C)</summary>

</details>


<details>
<summary>Shift Controller(225C)</summary>

Costs 225 credits, Weighs 4

The Shift Controller is a short-range portable teleporter that saves your coordinates and can then teleport you back to that location as long as it has battery remaining.

- The Shift Controller saves its coordinates when used the first time and the second use will then teleport you back to those initial saved coordinates at the cost of some battery.

- The Shift Controller consumes battery slowly after your coordinates have been saved but the teleport hasn't yet been used.

- The saved coordinates are wiped when the controller is recharged.

- The Shift controller is disabled in orbit.

Shift controller connectivity mechanic:
 - The Shift Controller's connectivity is based on how far you are from the saved coordinates, the farther you are --> the lower the connectivity. With full connectivity the controller works as expected but when connectivity starts to get low the controller will have a chance to glitch. When the controller glitches it will wipe your saved location and prevent you from using the controller for a short time.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Toolbox(115C)</summary>

- The defibrillator has a charge meter (Not related to its battery) on the side of it. The charge meter indicate how long you've held down the use button and it must be fully charged to successfully revive a player.

- When the charge meter is full you can continue to hold the use button and be ready to revive at a moments notice but its battery will be constantly drained when holding its charge.

- A battery cost is deducted when you release the use button at full charge regardless of whether a player was revived or not.

</details>

## Obtainable Scrap Items

<details>
<summary>Fuel Cylinder</summary>

High value, Weighs 32, Spawns anywhere rarely

When the Fuel cylinder is picked up it will have a high chance of activating. If successful, an internal timer will begin counting down to 0 which will then cause the tank to explode. The only way to deactivate the timer is by bringing the tank back to your ship safely.

- The internal timer can be any time around 3 minutes, better get moving!
- Hitting the tank with a melee weapon will cause it to explode immediately.
- Each time the tank is dropped, its remaining time will be reduced by a percentage; On the third drop, the tank will explode immediately.
- After being brought to the ship the tank will enter an inactive state, stopping the timer. In the inactive state, Hitting it will still cause it to explode and it can be reactivated by dropping it a few times (Dropping it will only cause a explosion if it is active).

Tips for survival - Take it first or take it last and know the way back to the ship, the last thing you want to do while carrying the tank is waste time trying to find your way back to the ship.

- The Cell inflicts ramping damage on a rough curve going from 5 to 20.

Tips for survival - The damage ramps based on how long you've held it continuously, so just drop it to reset the damage ramp to take minimum damage, sometimes it's just safer to leave it behind.

</details>

<summary>Capsules</summary>

High value, Weighs 16, Spawns anywhere rarely

Capsules will do different things depending on other in-game factors like the time of day, objects around you, or your health state for example.

Average value, Weighs 14, Spawns anywhere rarely

The Candy Dispenser is a melee weapon that will rarely drop a piece of candy when swinging it (1/25 chance each swing).

- The candy dropped by the dispenser is worth a small amount (It looks blank on clients but is still worth, I will fix this eventually) and gives a decent speed or jump boost when eaten.
