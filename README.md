PROS - 
- The lamp lights up the area around the holder in a radius that is larger than a baby flashlight's light reaches but not as large as a pro-flashlight reaches in one direction.

<summary>Medkit(90C)</summary>

Costs 90 credits, Weighs 4

The med-kit heals the user overtime when used. It has a limited amount of health it can heal (240) but it can be refilled by returning to your ship.

When compared to bandages, the med-kit can heal 4x the amount bandages can heal in one go and that's ignoring that it can be restocked infinitely. The med-kit is the better long-term option for healing if you aren't being actively killed.

<summary>Mod Compatibility Issues</summary>

- As the pool of mods gets larger, I will just say that any mods that affect world lighting or the flashlight's light will effect the Handlamp potentially making it brighter or duller. I will fix this later.
