## Purchasable Equipment
<details>
<summary>Handlamp (20C)</summary>

Costs 25 credits, Weighs 5

Compared to vanilla flashlights...

PROS

- The lamp lights up the area around the holder in a radius that is larger than a baby flashlight's light reaches but not as large as a pro-flashlight reaches in one direction.

- The lamp has a noticeably larger battery capacity than the pro-flashlight (It's battery can last almost the entire day when left on constantly).

CONS 

- The light produced by the lamp isn't as clear at long ranges as the pro-flashlight.

- The lamp's light is pretty bright if used in fog, gas, smoke, dust storms, etc..

Mod Issue - Mods messing with global lighting can drastically affect the Hand Lamp making it basically unusable. Haven't found a universal way to fix this issue unfortunately.

<details>
<summary>Bandages(20C)</summary>

</details>

<summary>Medical Kit(90C)</summary>

Costs 90 credits, Weighs 3

The Medical Kit heals the user overtime when used. It has a limited amount of health it can heal at once (240) but will replenish its availbe health overtime.

<details>
<summary>Emergency Injector(60C)</summary>

Costs 60 credits, Weighs 1

When used, the Emergency Injector gives you a speed boost, boosts your sprint meter capacity, refills your stamina, and gives you a jump boost.

- The effect lasts for 1 minute. After 1 minute you will receive a severe slowness debuff and your stamina will be drained.
- If another injector is used while you already have the effect you will quickly take damage and the effect will not stack or be reapplied.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Shift Controller(225C)</summary>

Costs 225 credits, Weighs 4

The Shift Controller is a portable teleporter that saves your coordinates and can then teleport you back there as long as it has battery.

- The Shift Controller's saved coordinates are set when used the first time, the second use will teleport you back at the cost of some of its battery.
- The Shift Controller consumes battery slowly after your coordinates have been set.
- The saved coordinates are wiped when the controller is recharged.

Shift controller connectivity mechanic:
 - The Shift Controller's connectivity is based on how far you are from the saved location, the farther you are the lower the connectivity. With full connectivity the controller works as expected but when connectivity starts to lower the controller will begin to experience glitches. Glitches will wipe your saved location and prevent you from using the controller for a short time.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Toolbox(115C)</summary>

Costs 115 credits, Weighs 5

The Tool Box can be used to dismantle landmines and turrets and will produce scrap when done successfully.

- To dismantle a trap, look at it, press and hold the Left Click button, and listen for the sound effect playing, the sound means it's working. It is a bit wonky when crouching, when around weird geometry, or when the vanilla traps are changed (like bigger landmines).
- Landmines produce 1 piece of scrap and take 6 seconds to dismantle.
- Turrets produce 2-3 pieces of scrap and take 12 seconds to dismantle.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Defibrillator(375c)</summary>

Costs 375 credits, Weighs 3

The defibrillator uses power to revive up to 3 deceased employees.

- The defibrillator has a charge meter (Not related to power) on the side of it. The charge meter indicate how long you've held down the use button and it must be fully charged to revive a player.
- When the charge meter is full but you continue to hold the use button you can be ready to revive at a moments notice but keep in mind that the items power is constantly drained when charging.
- A power cost is used when you release the use button at full charge regardless of if a player was revived or not.

- Currently I've made players cut in half (butler, sizable scissors) impossible to revive. I may make more death types perma death or may just remove this, we shall see.

<details>
<summary>Explosive Tank</summary>

High value, Weighs 32, Spawns anywhere rarely

Once the explosive tank is picked up, an internal timer will begin counting down to 0 which will then cause the tank to explode. The only way to deactivate the timer is by bringing the tank back to your ship safely.

- The internal timer can be any time around 3 minutes, better get moving!
- Hitting the tank with a melee weapon will cause it to explode. immediately.
- Each time the tank is dropped, its remaining time will be reduced by a percentage; On the third drop, the Tank will explode immediately.
- After being brought to the ship the Tank will be in a inactive state, stopping the timer. In the inactive state, Hitting it will still cause it to explode and it can be reactivated by dropping it a few times (Dropping it only causes a explosion while it is active).

Tips for survival - Take it first or take it last and know the way back to the ship, the last thing you want to do while carrying the tank is waste time being lost or wandering.
