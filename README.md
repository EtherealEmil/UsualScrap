### I will fix any issues that are reported to me but I'm taking leave from the company until the next update, see y'all then. 
## Purchasable Equipment
<details>
<summary>HandLamp (25C)</summary>

Costs 25 credits, Weighs 5

Compared to vanilla light sources...

PROS - 
- The lamp lights up the area around the holder in a radius that is larger than a baby flashlight's light reaches but not as large as a pro-flashlight reaches in one direction.
- The lamp has a noticeably larger battery capacity than the pro-flashlight (It's battery can last the entire day pretty reliably).

CONS - 
- The light produced by the lamp isn't as clear at long ranges as the pro-flashlight.
- The lamp's light is very bright if used in fog, gas, smoke, dust storms, etc..

<details>
<summary>Bandages(20C)</summary>

Costs 20 credits, Weighs 1

Bandages are a 3 use consumable item that heals 20 health per use.

When compared to the medkit, bandages will heal you instantly and weigh less so you can better survive those quick deadly encounters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Medkit(90C)</summary>

Costs 90 credits, Weighs 4

The med-kit heals the user overtime when used. It has a limited amount of health it can heal (240) but it can be refilled by returning to your ship.

When compared to bandages, the med-kit can heal 4x the health bandages can heal in one go and that's ignoring that it can be refilled infinitely. The med-kit is the better long-term option for healing if you aren't being actively killed.
</details>

Costs 150 credits, Weighs 6

The can be used to dismantle landmines and turrets and will produce a piece of scrap when done successfully.

- Landmines can be dismantle at any time prior to exploding.

- Some UI or effects to show that it's working will be added soon.

### Report issues on my GitHub! I will list issues/Limitations below for easy viewing on mod-managers.
<details>
<summary>Issues</summary>

- Last I checked, in the vanilla game the player health UI doesn't change back to white when healing because there aren't any ways to heal back to full health in the vanilla game outside of respawning, The only thing I will do is recommend you use a mod that displays your health as a number so you can easily tell you're health is actually increasing.

- As the pool of mods gets larger, I will just say that any mods that change the global lighting may affect the Handlamp potentially making it brighter or duller.
