## Purchasable Equipment

<details>
<summary>Handlamp</summary>

The handlamp is an alternative option to the usual flashlight; it makes light in an area around it instead of the beam of a normal flashlight

Mod Issue! - Mods messing with lighting can drastically change the lamp's light, there won't be a univeral way for me to fix this issue

</details>

<details>
<summary>Bandages</summary>

Bandages are a 3 use consumable item that heals instantly

Compared to the medical kit, bandages... 

- Heal instantly

- Weigh less

- Are cheap and disposable

</details>

<details>
<summary>Medical Kit</summary>

The Medical Kit heals the user overtime using it's internal stored health pool. It's max internal health caps out at 150 and will passively replenish when idle.

Compared to Bandages, the medical kit... 

- Is infinite healing if giving time to replenish

- Can be used to heal teammates at 2x the healing rate

<details>
<summary>Productivity Auto-Injector</summary>

The Auto-Injector is a single use item that applies the following buffs to the player who used it for 3 minutes...

- Speed boost

- Jump Height boost

- Negates the effects of carry weight

</details>


<details>
<summary>Shift Controller</summary>

The Shift Controller is a short-range portable teleporter that saves your coordinates and can teleport you back to that location as long as it has battery remaining.

- The shift controller saves its coordinates when used the FIRST time and will then teleport you back to those initial saved coordinates when used a SECOND time, at the cost of some battery.

- The shift controller consumes battery slowly when you've saved coordinates but haven't yet teleported

- The saved coordinates can be wiped under certain conditions, like when it's recharged via the ship recharger

- The Shift controller is disabled in orbit

Shift controller connectivity mechanic:
 - The Shift Controller's connectivity is based on how far you are from the saved coordinates, the farther you are --> the lower the connectivity. With full connectivity the controller works as expected but when connectivity starts to get low the controller will have a chance to "glitch". When the controller glitches it will wipe your saved location and prevent you from using the controller for a short time.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Toolbox</summary>

The Tool Box can be used to dismantle traps and will produce scrap when done successfully.

To dismantle a trap, stand by it and hold left click. You should see sparks and here a sound cue, and after short period of time (the time depends on the trap) the trap will be dismantled and drop a number of scrap parts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Defibrillator</summary>

The defibrillator uses battery to revive deceased employees.

- The defibrillator has a charge meter (Not related to its battery) on the side of it. The charge meter indicates how long you've held down the use button and it must be fully charged to revive a player.

- When the charge meter is full you can continue to hold the use button and be ready to revive at a moments notice but its battery will be constantly drained when holding its charge.

- A battery cost is deducted when you release the use button at full charge regardless of whether a player was revived or not.

</details>

## Discoverable Scrap

<details>
<summary>Fuel Cylinder</summary>

When the Fuel cylinder is picked up it will have a high chance of activating. If successful, an internal timer will begin counting down to 0 which will then cause the tank to explode. The only way to deactivate the timer is by bringing the tank back to your ship safely.

- The internal timer can be any time around 3 minutes, better get moving!

- Hitting the tank with a melee weapon will cause it to explode immediately

- Each time the tank is dropped, its remaining time will be reduced by a percentage; On the third drop, the tank will explode immediately

- After being brought to the ship the tank will enter an inactive state, stopping the timer. In the inactive state, Hitting it will still cause it to explode and it can be reactivated by dropping it a few times (Dropping it will only cause a explosion if it is active).

Tips for survival - Take it first or take it last and know the way back to the ship, the last thing you want to do while carrying the cylinder is waste time trying to find your way back to the ship.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Radioactive Cell</summary>

The Radioactive Cell produces a sickly green light in a radius around it infinitely. When the cell is held, the holder will regularly take ramping damage until they drop it or perish.

- The Cell inflicts ramping damage on a rough curve going from 5 to 20.

Tips for survival - The damage ramps based on how long you've held it continuously, so just drop it to reset the damage ramp to take minimum damage, sometimes it's just safer to leave it behind.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Capsules</summary>

Gloomy Capsule - Charges during the evening and night, when fully charged it will randomly teleport it's holder either indoors or outdoors depending on their current location

Frigid Capsule - Charges during the evening and night, when fully charged it sends out waves of snow that will apply stacks of slowness to all nearby players

Sacrifical Capsule - Drains health from all nearby players, WIP

Noxious capsule - Charges during the dawn and noon, when fully charged nox gas begins to seep out damaging all players nearby rapidly, WIP
</details>


<details>
<summary>Crowbar</summary>

The Crowbar is a melee weapon that does average damage and can unlock locked doors by smacking the door 3 times

</details>

<details>
<summary>Padlock</summary>

<details>
<summary>Sizable Scissors</summary>

Sizable Scissors are a two handed melee weapon that deals double damage and randomly damages it's holder if they are sprinting.

Tips for survival - don't run with them or drop them. If the scissors kill you then you ran with scissors, what'd you expect?
</details>

<details>

<summary>Candy Dispenser</summary>

The Candy Dispenser is a melee weapon that will rarely drop a piece of candy when swinging it (1/25 chance each swing).

- The candy dropped by the dispenser is worth a small amount (It looks blank on clients but is still worth, I will fix this eventually) and gives a decent speed or jump boost when eaten.
- The candy dispenser will not drop candy if the ship is in orbit or if it is on moon that has no time cycle like the company building.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Rose</summary>

The rose damages you a small amount when picked up, equipped, and dropped.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Tickets of Exchange</summary>

The Regular Ticket of Exchange is a consumable item that can be used to transform any ONE item into a gift box, essentially exchanging it for something else.

The Golden Ticket of Exchange is a extremely rare variant that does the same thing it predecessor does but will turn many surrounding items into gift boxes instead of just one.

- Ticket are disabled while inside the company cruiser to avoid severely breaking the game.
