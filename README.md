## Purchasable Equipment
<details>
<summary>Hand Lamp (25C)</summary>

Costs 25 credits, Weighs 5

Compared to vanilla flashlights...

PROS

- The lamp lights up the area around the holder in a radius that is larger than a baby flashlight's light reaches but not as large as a pro-flashlight reaches in one direction.

- The lamp has a noticeably larger battery capacity than the pro-flashlight (It's battery can last almost the entire day when left on constantly).

CONS 

- The light produced by the lamp isn't as clear at long ranges as the pro-flashlight.

- The lamp's light is pretty bright if used in fog, gas, smoke, dust storms, etc..

Mod Issue - Mods messing with global lighting can drastically affect the Hand Lamp making it basically unusable. Haven't found a universal way to fix this issue unfortunately.

## Obtainable Scrap Items

<details>
<summary>Explosive Tank</summary>

High value, Weighs 32, Spawns anywhere rarely

Once the explosive tank is picked up, an internal timer will begin counting down to 0 which will then cause the tank to explode. The only way to deactivate the timer is by bringing the tank back to your ship safely.

- The internal timer can be any time between 2 and 3 minutes, better get moving!
- Hitting the tank with a melee weapon will cause it to explode. immediately.
- Each time the tank is dropped, its remaining time will be reduced by a percentage; On the third drop, the Tank will explode immediately.
- After being brought to the ship the Tank will be in a inactive state, stopping the timer. In the inactive state, Hitting it will still cause it to explode and it can be reactivated by dropping it a few times (Dropping it only causes a explosion while it is active).

Tips for survival - Take it first or take it last and know the way back to the ship, the last thing you want to do while carrying the tank is waste time being lost or wandering.

The Radioactive Cell produces a sickly green light in a radius around it infinitely. When the cell is held, the holder will regularly take damage until they drop it or perish.

 I will list issues/Limitations below for easy viewing on mod-managers.

<details>
<summary>Issues</summary>

- Last I checked, in the vanilla game the player health UI doesn't change back to white when healing because there aren't any ways to heal back to full health outside of respawning, The only thing I will do is recommend you use a mod that displays your health as a number so you can easily tell you're health is actually increasing.
